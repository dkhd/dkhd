**💻 Software Engineer | 🔒 Narrative Security | 🛡️ Disinformation Resilience | 🏕️ Digital Survivability**

> Welcome to a rare public outpost from the intersection of narrative security, adversarial information environments, and cognitive resilience.

## 👤 About

A Software Engineer working at the intersection of narrative security, disinformation resilience, and digital survivability in adversarial environments.

For over 15 years, I’ve designed and deployed platforms across education, entrepreneurship, startups, and digital learning ecosystems—building systems that lower barriers to entry, increase user autonomy, and make digital complexity intelligible.

**In the last half decade:**  
My focus has shifted toward systems development for contested information environments—creating tools and platforms adopted by civilian networks and transatlantic defense-aligned organizations. The mission: strengthen resistance against psychological manipulation, information warfare, and coordinated disinformation campaigns engineered to fracture belief and destabilize trust.

Today, my work centers on building systems that:
- Expose manipulation
- Simulate influence operations
- Reinforce trust under pressure

**But here’s the challenge:**  
Much of this work has taken place in high-context environments where the systems are real, the stakes are high, but the portfolio is invisible _(by design)_.

## 🛡️ NISKALA

Since my portfolio is intentionally invisible, I founded [NISKALA](https://niskala.systems): A self-directed, independent R&D lab focused on adversarial narrative environments. It is a sovereign infrastructure for prototyping advanced narrative intelligence systems, operating at the intersection of [InfoOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Operations_(United_States)), [PsyOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States)), AI, and [cognitive security](https://blackbird.ai/blog/what-is-cognitive-security).

**Current focus areas:**
- Counter-disinformation infrastructure
- Narrative system design
- Cognitive threat modeling
- Simulation of adversarial messages
- Educational systems for digital resilience
